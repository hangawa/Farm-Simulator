# Farm-Simulator
## Introduction
Hello! My name is Hannah Walkup and I am a freshman at the University of Texas at Arlington, majoring in Computer Science. 
This is my first game, written after completing CSE 1310 at my school, Introduction to Computers & Programming. 
It is a text-based farming management simulator inspired by Stardew Valley, written in C. 

## Gameplay
You, the player, must collect funds to keep a recently inherited farm. 
You accumulate funds by performing various farming and product processing chores.

## How I made the game
This program has features including a time-based gameplay loop (in days and hours), inventory management, an upgrade system and an ability to win or lose. 
To write this game, I used core programming concepts, including functions & pointers, loops, conditionals, and user input. 

## How to run this game
This program is written in C and runs in a terminal. I run it in a VS Code terminal.
Steps to run the game:
1. Download this repository
2. Open it in VS Code
3. Compile the program by typing: "gcc farmsim.c"
4. Run the program by typing: "./a.out"
The program will run interactively in the terminal and prompt the user for input.
